## Intro
Enrollment and Identity Proofing provides detailed requirements and controls for individuals' enrollment and identity proofing in digital identity systems. These resources provide informational guidance for implementing services, controls, and requirements. 

**Identity Proofing:** A Credential Service Provider (CSP) collects and verifies information about a person for the purpose of issuing credentials to that person. 

Journey

Resolution - > Validation -> Verification

- Resolve: A claimed identity to a single unique identity within the context of the population of users served by the CSP.
- Validate: All evidence supplied is valid and genuine, and the claimed identity exists in the real world. 
- Verify: Claimed identity is associated with the real person supplying the identity evidence. 

## Proccees
Requires CSP to document the identity proofing and enrollment processes in an applicable written policy or practice statement that specifies the steps used to perform identity proofing and enrollment processes. Such documented policies and procedures are fundamental controls and prerequisites for transparency, accountability, quality control, auditability, and interoperability among federated communities. 

This document should present the specific steps in identity proofing and enrolling applicants into the CSP identity system. The process documentation should also present the procedures for addressing errors and circumstances that result in failure to enroll applicants in the identity system successfully. Such circumstances that may result in the inability or failure to complete the identity proofing and enrollment processes include

- Applicant abandons the identity proofing and enrollment processes;
- Applicant fails to provide mandatory attribute information;
- Identity evidence of required strength is not provided;
- Identity evidence is rejected following inspection;
- Identity evidence and information do not correlate;
- Information from identity evidence is not validated by issuing or authoritative sources at the required strength
- Identity verification of binding to the applicant fails, and the Applicant fails to confirm the enrollment code within its validity period

SP 800-63A does not specify required actions or procedures to address such circumstances. The CSP should determine the appropriate processing steps and include applicable written documentation in the identity-proofing procedural documentation. 

It is also recommended that this documentation include the information and activities collected, recorded, and maintained in the enrollment records and audit  logs of identity-proofing activities and events. Key security-related activities and tasks for such enrollment records and documentation associated with the identity proofing process may include. 

- Identity information collected;
- Identity evidence provided;
- Identity evidence validated;
- Identity evidence validation source;
- Identity evidence binding verification method;
- Identity evidence verification result;
- Enrollment code confirmation result;
- Enrollment result;
- Authenticator registration.

CSP may find it useful to consult the reference guidance published by  the MITRE corporation.

## Resulotion
The identity resolution step in identity proofing processes and the collection of core identity attributes are parallel processes to establish a unique representation of the individual's identity for use during the proofing process and enrollment. The objective of the collection of core identity attributes is to resolve applicants' identities to a single unique entity for the given population and context. The types of identity attributes that may be retrieved from identity documents and used for identity resolution typically include

- name (first, last, middle) with combinations and variations,
- address (number, street, state, zip code) with combinations and variations,
- birth date (day, month, year) with combinations and variations,
- email address,
- phone number

The types of identity attributes may be presented in different formats. There are many different types of identity attributes and information that may be collected and considered for identity resolution. 

SP 800-63A limits the attribute information that may be collected and maintained. PII shall be limited to the minimum necessary to resolve a unique identity in a given context to validate the claimed identity and associate the claimed identity with the applicant, providing identity evidence for appropriate identity resolution, validation, and verification. This may include the collection of attributes that assist in data queries. 

The goal of identity resolution is to distinguish an individual within a given population or context uniquely. Effective identity resolution uses the minimum attributes necessary to resolve a unique individual. 

- The types of personal information necessary for collection
- whether such information is mandatory or voluntary
- purposes for the collection and maintenance of personal information and attributes
- Whether the information will be retained and how it will be protected
- consequences of failure to provide required information.

## A3.1 Collection Tecuhniques
Initial application information may be captured via an online form directly from the applicant being proofed. In other cases, the CSP may allow the applicant to provide some documents via remote means, such as submitting an image of an identification document like a passport or driver's license.

- Document Image capture: Camera
- Document Image capture: Scanner
- Barcode: Scanner
 
If the CSP performs in-person registration, it may consider, for efficiency and convenience purposes, executing additional steps in the process, such as evidence validation, at the time of registration. The CSP may provide Kiosks to allow an applicant to enter their information directly or have a representative enter it on their behalf.
