**Biometrics Collection Use Cases:**

1. **Biometric Matching for Identity Verification:** Biometrics collection is performed to match biometric data objects contained on identity evidence for the purpose of identity verification. This is used for FAIR, STRONG, and SUPERIOR evidence strengths. Biometric collection can be done for both in-person and remote identity-proofing processes. It's optional for FAIR and STRONG evidence but required for SUPERIOR evidence verification binding.

2. **Enrollment and Registration of Biometric Characteristics:** Biometrics collection is done to enroll and register biometric characteristics as an authentication factor in the subscriber's enrollment account. This is required for IAL3 enrollment and optional for IAL2 account enrollment, whether identity proofing is in-person or remote.

**In-Person Identity Proofing Biometrics Collection:**
- Requirements for in-person biometrics collection are provided in SP 800-63A section 5.3.3.1.
- These requirements prevent impersonation, presentation, and spoofing attacks during in-person identity proofing.
- These requirements apply to both use cases mentioned above.

**Remote Identity Proofing Biometrics Collection:**
- Biometrics collection for remote identity proofing and enrollment, whether for identity verification or enrollment purposes, typically involves facial image capture.
- However, it can be performed for any biometric modality.
- Regardless of the biometric modality, controls against impersonation, presentation, and spoofing attacks are necessary.
- For IAL3 in-person identity proofing comparability, the controls presented in SP 800-63A section 5.3.3.2 apply to supervised remote identity proofing.
- These controls allow the remote operator to monitor the applicant throughout the proofing session and inspect the biometric source to detect spoofing or presentation attacks.

In summary, biometrics collection is crucial for identity verification, especially at SUPERIOR evidence strength, and it may also be used for enrollment and registration of biometric characteristics for authentication purposes. The collection requirements apply to in-person and remote identity proofing, with specific controls to mitigate security risks associated with biometrics data.
