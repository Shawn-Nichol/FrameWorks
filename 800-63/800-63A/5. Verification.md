Here are the short notes summarizing the document section:

**A.5 Identity Verification**

**Objective:** Identity verification confirms that the validated evidence refers to the applicant appearing for identity proofing, establishing a binding between the evidence and the individual's live existence.

**Verification Strengths and Methods:**
1. **SUPERIOR:** Biometric Verification
   - Compares biometric characteristics (e.g., facial image) to the strongest evidence of live biometric capture.
   - Applicable to FAIR, STRONG, and SUPERIOR strength.
2. **STRONG:** In-Person and Remote Physical Verification
   - Compares the applicant to the facial-image photograph on the strongest validated evidence.
   - Applicable to FAIR and STRONG strength.
3. **FAIR:** Knowledge-Based Verification (KBV)
   - Compares challenge-response to KBV questions provided by the applicant.
   - Applicable to FAIR strength only.

**Physical Comparison:** A person (e.g., CSP-trained personnel) compares the applicant to the facial image photograph on the strongest validated evidence, in-person or remotely.

**Biometric Comparison:** Automated comparison of a biometric characteristic (e.g., facial image) from the strongest evidence to a live capture of the same characteristic during identity proofing.

**Verification Requirements:**
- Physical or biometric comparison is required for STRONG and SUPERIOR verification strength.
- For IAL2 remote identity proofing, either physical or biometric comparison can be performed based on the strongest validated identity evidence.
- Liveness detection is crucial to ensure the applicant's facial image is live and not a spoof.
- Methods for remote identity proofing involving liveness detection include supervision by a remote operator, automated capabilities with liveness detection, or liveness detection during facial image capture.

**Note:** Verification is performed against the strongest piece of validated identity evidence, which is either STRONG or SUPERIOR evidence for IAL2 and IAL3. FAIR evidence-binding verification is not required at these levels.

These notes provide an overview of the identity verification process, including methods and requirements for verification strengths.
