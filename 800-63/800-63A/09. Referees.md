The use of Trusted Referees in identity proofing and enrollment processes, as outlined in SP 800-63A section 5.3.4, is intended to provide an optional mechanism for assisting populations that may face challenges in meeting IAL2 and IAL3 identity proofing requirements or have difficulty completing the identity proofing and enrollment processes. Trusted referees can play a crucial role in helping such individuals establish their identity for various purposes, including access to online services. Here are key points regarding the use of Trusted Referees:

**Eligible Populations:**
- Trusted referees can be used for identity proofing and enrollment for populations that may include:
  - Disabled individuals.
  - Elderly individuals.
  - Homeless individuals.
  - Individuals with limited access to online services or computing devices.
  - Unbanked individuals with little or no credit history.
  - Victims of identity theft.
  - Children under 18.
  - Immigrants and others.

**Flexibility for CSPs:**
- The use of trusted referees is optional for CSPs, and they have flexibility in establishing processes to accommodate the needs and operational context of the target populations.
- SP 800-63A intentionally avoids overly prescriptive requirements to allow CSPs to adapt the use of trusted referees to their specific circumstances.

**Documentation Requirements:**
- CSPs are required to create written documentation of their policies and procedures for the use of trusted referees.
- This documentation serves both to ensure that the policies and procedures meet applicable SP 800-63A IAL2 and IAL3 requirements and to provide transparency to external entities about how trusted referees are used in the identity proofing and enrollment process.
- The documentation may include details such as the types of trusted referees permitted, the roles of trusted referees, the enrollment procedures for trusted referees, identity proofing processes for both trusted referees and the applicants they represent, the relationship between trusted referees and applicants, record-keeping procedures for trusted referees, and contact and communication procedures for trusted referees and applicants.

**Qualified Trusted Referees:**
- Trusted referees can be individuals who are qualified to act on behalf of or represent the applicant.
- Examples of qualified trusted referees include notaries, legal guardians, medical professionals, conservators, individuals with power of attorney, and other trusted individuals who can vouch for the applicant's identity.

In summary, the use of Trusted Referees is an optional mechanism that provides flexibility for CSPs to assist populations facing identity proofing challenges. The specific policies and procedures for utilizing trusted referees should be documented by CSPs to ensure compliance with applicable requirements and to provide transparency to external entities. Trusted referees can play a valuable role in helping individuals establish their identity for various purposes, even when traditional identity proofing methods may not be readily accessible or suitable.
