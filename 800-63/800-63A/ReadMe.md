# Identity Proofing Process (IAL2 Remote)

## Overview

This README section outlines the identity proofing process, specifically focusing on Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) for remote identity proofing. It encompasses several key stages: identity resolution, validation, verification, enrollment, biometrics, supervised remote identity proofing, and referees. These processes are crucial for ensuring the security and reliability of online identity verification.

## Identity Resolution

**Identity resolution** is the initial step where applicants provide their attribute information and one to three forms of identity evidence. In cases of ambiguity, Knowledge-Based Verification (KBV) may be employed to resolve discrepancies.

## Validation

**Validation** is the process of confirming the authenticity, integrity, and accuracy of identity evidence collected from applicants. This step includes checking for completeness, evidence tampering, counterfeit evidence, and security features.

## Verification

**Verification** aims to confirm that the validated identity evidence matches the applicant's real-world identity. This can be achieved through physical or biometric comparison, including liveness detection. KBV may be used for verification but not as the sole method.

## Enrollment

**Enrollment** involves sending an enrollment code to a validated address (postal, SMS, or email) for further confirmation of the binding of validated identity evidence to the applicant. Specific validity periods apply to these codes, ensuring secure enrollment.

## Biometrics

Biometric comparison plays a crucial role in identity verification, including facial image comparison, fingerprint scanning, and iris recognition. This enhances the security of the proofing process.

## Supervised Remote Identity Proofing

**Supervised remote identity proofing** is designed to provide the same level of confidence and security as in-person IAL3 identity proofing. It requires specialized equipment and controls at a remote location, ensuring stringent security standards.

## Referees

In some cases, additional referees may be involved to vouch for the applicant's identity, adding an extra layer of validation and security to the process.

## IAL2 Remote Identity Proofing

IAL2 is a specific Identity Assurance Level that emphasizes the balance between security and convenience. It allows for remote identity proofing, expanding access to services while maintaining stringent security measures.

## Usage

This README section provides an understanding of the key components of the identity proofing process at IAL2 for remote verification. It can serve as a reference guide for developers, security professionals, and organizations implementing identity proofing solutions.
