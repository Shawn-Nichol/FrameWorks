Here are the short notes summarizing the document:

**A.3 Identity Resolution and Evidence Collection**

- **Identity Resolution:** This step aims to establish a unique representation of an individual's identity during the proofing and enrollment process.
- **Core Identity Attributes:** These include name, address, birth date, email address, and phone number. Various formats and combinations can be used.
- **Limitations on Attribute Collection:** Collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) should be minimal, relevant to the context, and necessary for identity resolution and validation.
- **Notice of Identity Proofing:** Applicants should be informed about the types of information collected, whether it's mandatory or voluntary, purposes of collection, data retention, and consequences of not providing required information.

**A.3.1 Collection Techniques**

- **Digital Collection:** Applicants can provide information and evidence digitally. Methods include document image capture using cameras or scanners, barcode scanning, and more.
- **In-Person Collection:** In-person registration can include evidence validation, and kiosks or CSP representatives may be involved in data entry. Verification of captured information is important.

**A.3.2 Strength of Evidence**

- **Identity Assurance Levels (IAL):** SP 800-63A specifies the amount and strength of identity evidence needed to meet IAL2 and IAL3 assurance levels.
- **Strength Classifications:** Identity evidence is categorized as UNACCEPTABLE, WEAK, FAIR, STRONG, or SUPERIOR. Certain combinations of STRONG and SUPERIOR evidence can meet IAL2 and IAL3 requirements.
- **Notional Strength of Evidence:** Common types of evidence are classified based on quality characteristics. For example, US Passport, PIV card, and REAL ID cards are considered SUPERIOR or STRONG+.

These notes provide an overview of identity resolution, evidence collection, and the strength of evidence in the identity proofing process.
