**A.4 Identity Validation**

**Objective:** Identity validation aims to verify the authenticity, integrity, and accuracy of the evidence collected during identity proofing.

**Two Key Steps in Identity Validation:**
1. **Validation of Evidence Authenticity:** Ensures the evidence is genuine and free from tampering or counterfeiting. It includes confirming required information completeness, format, and security features.
   - Validity Levels: SP 800-63A presents validation techniques for five levels of validation strength, ranging from UNACCEPTABLE to SUPERIOR.
   - Use of "Appropriate Technologies": Identity document validation products and services may be used to perform authenticity tests.
   - Security Features Confirmation: Various security features (e.g., holographic images, UV printing) require visual, tactile, or specialized equipment examination.

2. **Evidence Information Validation:** Validates the correctness of information from identity evidence against the issuing source or authoritative source.
   - Applicable to STRONG and SUPERIOR strength evidence.
   - May not be possible for all personal and evidence details, depending on the type of evidence.
   - Record Results: The results of evidence information validation and evidence genuineness validation should be recorded in enrollment records or audit logs.

**Training for Personnel:** Personnel involved in evidence validation should undergo training based on CSP or RP policies, guidelines, or requirements.

**Remote Identity Proofing:** Remote identity proofing presents challenges for evidence validation, making automated evidence validation solutions useful. If not used, CSPs may use trained operators or automated interfaces to guide applicants during remote proofing. Training for remote proofing personnel depends on CSP policies and procedures.

**Recording Results:** The outcomes of evidence information validation and evidence genuineness validation should be documented in enrollment records or audit logs as appropriate for the CSP.

These notes provide an overview of the identity validation process, including authenticity and information validation for identity evidence.
