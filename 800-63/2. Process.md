Here are the notes summarizing the document:

**Title:** Identity Proofing Process Documentation

**Objective:** This document outlines the requirements and guidelines for documenting identity proofing and enrollment processes in digital identity systems.

**Importance of Documentation:**
- **Transparency and Accountability:** Documented policies and procedures are essential for transparency and accountability.
- **Quality Control:** Documentation helps maintain the quality of identity management processes.
- **Auditability:** It enables effective audit trails.
- **Interoperability:** Documentation promotes interoperability among federated communities.

**Contents of Documentation:**
- The documentation should specify the steps involved in identity proofing and enrolling applicants into the CSP identity system.
- It should also address procedures for handling errors and situations where enrollment fails, including when:
   - An applicant abandons the process.
   - Mandatory attribute information is missing.
   - Identity evidence doesn't meet the required strength.
   - Identity evidence is rejected.
   - Identity evidence and information don't match.
   - Information from identity evidence isn't validated.
   - Identity evidence verification fails.
   - The applicant doesn't confirm the enrollment code within its validity period.

**Handling Unique Situations:**
- The document doesn't prescribe specific actions for addressing these circumstances but leaves it to the CSP to determine appropriate processing steps.
- The CSP should include these steps in the identity proofing procedural documentation.

**Enrollment Records and Audit Logs:**
- The documentation should also cover the information and activities to be collected, recorded, and maintained in enrollment records and audit logs of identity proofing activities.
- Key security-related activities and steps to be recorded include:
   - Identity information collected.
   - Identity evidence provided.
   - Identity evidence validated.
   - Identity evidence validation source.
   - Identity evidence binding verification method.
   - Identity evidence verification result.
   - Enrollment code confirmation result.
   - Enrollment result.
   - Authenticator registration.

**Additional Resources:**
- CSPs can refer to guidance from the MITRE Corporation (May 2020) for developing identity proofing and enrollment process documentation, especially for IAL2 and IAL3 remote identity proofing.
- This guidance provides a methodology, process flow, and customizable templates for creating an Enrollment and Identity Proofing Practices Statement.

In summary, this document emphasizes the importance of documenting identity proofing and enrollment processes, outlines what the documentation should cover, and suggests consulting external guidance for creating this documentation effectively.
