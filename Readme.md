Nation Institute of Standards and Technology is a federal United States Department of Commerce agency. NIST was founded in 1901 as the National Bureau of Standards and was later renamed to its current title in 1988. NISTs primary mission is to promote and maintain measurement standards as well as to advance technology and innovation in the US. 


It covers several branches, but we only care about Cybersecurity here. 

Cybersecurity: NIST is known for developing cybersecurity standards and guidelines, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which helps organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. 


## Frame Work COmponents
The framework consists of three main components

1. Framework Core:
The core is a set of desired cybersecurity activities and outcomes organized into categories and aligned to informative references. The core consists of three parts Functions, Categories, and Subcategories. The core includes five high-level functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

2. Framework Implementation Tiers
Tiers describe the degree to which an organization's cybersecurity risk management practices exhibit the characteristics defined in the framework. The tiers range from partial to adaptive and describe an increasing degree of rigor, how well-integrated cybersecurity risk decisions are into broader risk decisions, and the degree to which the organization shares and receives cybersecurity info from external parties.

3. Framework Profiles
Profiles are an organization's unique alignment of its organizational requirements and objectives, risk appetite, and resources against the desired outcomes of the Framework Core. Profiles can be used to identify opportunities for improving cyber security posture by comparing the Current profile with a target profile.  



### Identify
- Identify critical enterprise processes and assets: What are your enterprise's activities? 
- Document information flow: where the data is located and how it is used. 
- Maintain hardware and software inventory: know what computers and software in your enterprise they entry points of malicious actors.
- Establish policies for cybersecurity that include roles and responsibilities: These policies and procedures should clearly describe your expectations for how cybersecurity activities will protect your information and systems. 
- Identify threats, vulnerabilities, and risk to assets: Ensure risk management processes are established and managed to ensure internal and external threats are identified, assessed, and documented in risk registers. 

### Protect
- Manage access to assets and information: Create unique accounts for each employee and ensure that users only have access to information, computers, and applications needed for their jobs. Authenticate users before they are granted access to information
- Protect sensitive data: Data is protected by encryption both while it's stored on computers as well as when it's transmitted to other parties. Consider utilizing integrity checking to ensure that only approved changes to the data have been made.
- Conduct regular backups: Many operating systems have built-in backup capabilities; software and cloud solutions are also available that can automate the backup process
- Protect your devices: Consider installing host-based firewalls and other protection such as endpoints security products. Apply uniform configurations to devices and control changes to device configurations. Disable devices, services, or features that are not necessary to support mission functions.
- Manage Device vulnerabilities: Regularly update the OS and applications installed on your computers and other devices to protect them from attack. If possible, enable automatic updates. Consider using software tools to scan devices for additional vulnerabilities; remediate vulnerabilities with high likelihood and impact
- Train users: Regularly train and retrain all users to be sure they are aware of enterprise cybersecurity policies and procedures and their specific roles and responsibilities as a condition of employment.

### Detect
- Test and update detection processes: Develop and test processes and procedures for detecting unauthorized entities and actions on the networks and in the physical environment, including personnel activity. Staff should be aware of their roles and responsibilities for detection and related reporting both within your organization and external governance and legal authorities.
- Maintain and monitor logs: Logs are crucial in order to identify anomalies in your enterprise's computers and applications. These logs record events such as changes to systems or accounts as well as the initiation of communication channels. Consider using software tools that can aggregate these logs and look for patterns or anomalies from expected network behavior.
- Known the expected data flows for your enterprise: If you know what and how data is expected to be used for your enterprise, you are much more likely to notice when the unexpected happens, and the unexpected is never a good thing when it comes to security. Unexpected data flows might include customer information being exported from an internal database and exiting the network. If you have contracted work to a cloud or managed service provider, discuss with them how they track data flows and reports, including unexpected events.
- Understand the impact of cybersecurity events: If a cybersecurity event is detected, your enterprise should work quickly and thoroughly to understand the breadth and depth of the impact. Seek help. Communication information on the event with appropriate stakeholders will help keep you in good stead in terms of partners, oversight bodies, and others and improve policies and processes. 


### Respond
- Ensure response plans are tested: It's even more important to test response plans to make sure each person knows their responsibilities in executing the plan. The better prepared your organization is, the more effective the response is likely to be. This includes knowing any legal reporting requirements or required information sharing.
- Ensure response plans are updated: Testing the plan inevitably will reveal needed improvements. Be sure to update response plans with lessons learned.
- Coordinate with internal and external stakeholders: It's important to make sure that your enterprise's response plan and updates include all key stakeholders and external service providers. They can contribute to improvements in planning and execution.


  #### Recover:
- Communicate with the internal and external stakeholders: Recovery plans need to carefully account for what, how, and when the information will be shared with various stakeholders so that all interested parties receive the information they need but no inappropriate information is shared.
- Ensure  recovery plans are updated: As with response plans, testing execution will improve employee and partner awareness and highlight areas for improvement. Be sure to update recovery plans with lessons learned.
- Managed public relations and company reputation: one of the key aspects of recovery is managing the enterprise's reputation. When developing a recovery plan, consider how you will manage public relations so that your information sharing is accurate, complete, timely, and not reactionary.
