Provides organizational officals with 
- Evidence about the effectiveness of implemented controls
- An indication of the quality of the risk management processes employed within the organization
- Information about the strengths and weaknesses of information systems supporting organizational missions and business functions in a global environment of sophisticated and changing threats.

The assessment process is an information-gathering activity, not a security or privacy-producing activity. 

An organization can use the information produced during control assessments to:
- Identify potential problems or shortfalls in the organization's implementation of the Risk Management Framework.
- Identify security- and privacy-related weaknesses and deficiencies in the information system and the environment in which the system operates.
- Prioritize risk mitigation decisions and associated risk mitigation activities;
- Confirm that identified security and privacy-related weaknesses and deficiencies in the information system and the environment of the operation have been addressed.
- Support monitoring activities and information security and privacy situational awareness;
- Facilitate security authorization decisions, privacy authorization decisions, and ongoing authorization decisions.
- Inform budgetary decisions and the capital investment process.

Organizations are not expected to employ all of the assessment methods and assessment objects contained within the assessment procedures identified in the publication  for the associated security and privacy controls deployed.
