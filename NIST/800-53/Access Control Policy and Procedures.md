## AC-1 Access Control Policy and Procedures

### AC-1(1) Develop and disseminate an access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance. 

- Example: The policy should clearly define users' roles and their corresponding access levels. It should specify that only authorized personnel are allowed to access sensitive data.
- Recommended Practice: Regualry conduct access control training for employees to ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities regarding access permissions.

### AC-1(2)
Develop and disseminate procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access control controls. 

- Examples: Procdures should outline steps for granting access requests, including verification of user identity, approval from supervisors, and configuration and access permissions.
- Recommend Practice: Implement periodic audits to ensure that procedures are followed correctly and that access permissions are aligned with the policy.

### AC-1(3)
Review and update the access control policy and procedures on an organization-defined frequency and/or when there are significant changes to the organization or information system.

- Example: The policy and procedures should be reviewed annually and updated whenever there is a change in organizational structure or technology infrastructure.
- Recommend Practice: Establish a change control board to evaluate and approve proposed changes to access control policies and procedures.

### AC-1(4)
Define personnel or roles to whom exceptions to the access control policy can be granted and the process for obtaining such exceptions.

- Example: Exceptions might be granted to IT administrators during system upgrades, allowing temporary elevated access.
- Recommended Practice: Document and review exceptions regularly to ensure they are valid, necessary, and temporary. Implement a strict timeline for revoking exceptions.

### AC-1(5)
Establish a process for obtaining access to the organization-defined information system.

- Example: New employees should request access through a web-based portal, which triggers a workflow for approval by the employee's supervisor and IT department.
- Recommended Practice: Automate access request workflows to minimize delays in provisioning access for new employees. Regularly update access permissions based on changes in job roles.
