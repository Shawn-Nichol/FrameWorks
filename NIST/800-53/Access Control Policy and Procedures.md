## AC-1 Access Control Policy and Procedures

### AC-1(1) Develop and disseminate an access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance. 

- Example: The policy should clearly define users' roles and their corresponding access levels. It should specify that only authorized personnel are allowed to access sensitive data.
- Recommended Practice: Regualry conduct access control training for employees to ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities regarding access permissions.

### AC-1(2)
Develop and disseminate procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access control controls. 

- Examples: Procdures should outline steps for granting access requests, including verification of user identity, approval from supervisors, and configuration and access permissions.
- Recommend Practice: Implement periodic audits to ensure that procedures are followed correctly and that access permissions are aligned with the policy.

### AC-1(3)
Review and update the access control policy and procedures on an organization-defined frequency and/or when there are significant changes to the organization or information system.

- Example: The policy and procedures should be reviewed annually and updated whenever there is a change in organizational structure or technology infrastructure.
- Recommend Practice: Establish a change control board to evaluate and approve proposed changes to access control policies and procedures.

### AC-1(4)
Define personnel or roles to whom exceptions to the access control policy can be granted and the process for obtaining such exceptions.

- Example: Exceptions might be granted to IT administrators during system upgrades, allowing temporary elevated access.
- Recommended Practice: Document and review exceptions regularly to ensure they are valid, necessary, and temporary. Implement a strict timeline for revoking exceptions.

### AC-1(5)
Establish a process for obtaining access to the organization-defined information system.

- Example: New employees should request access through a web-based portal, which triggers a workflow for approval by the employee's supervisor and IT department.
- Recommended Practice: Automate access request workflows to minimize delays in provisioning access for new employees. Regularly update access permissions based on changes in job roles.

## AC-2: Account Managment

### AC-2(1)
Assigned an account manager

- Example: Designate the IT security officer as the account manager responsible for overseeing user accounts and access permissions
- Recommend Practice: Implement regular meetings between account managers and system administrators to review account status, ensuring timely deactivation of accounts for departing employees.

### AC-2(2)
Monitor the use of temporary accounts

- Example: Temporary accounts created for external contractors should have a predefined expiration date and are automatically disabled after project completion.
- Recommended Practice: Implement an automated system to monitor temporary accounts, ensuring they are deactivated promptly upon project completion or contract expiration.

### AC-2(3)
Enforce password complexity and change requirements

- Example: Passwords must be at least 12 characters long, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Users are required to change their passwords every 60 days.
- Recommended Practice: Implement multi-factor authentication in addition to strong password policies to enhance security. Encourage the use of passphrases, which are easier for users to remember and can be more secure.


## AC-3 Access Enforcement

### AC-3(1)
Enforce access restrictions associated with changes to the system's configuration in accordance with organizational policies and procedures. 

- Example: Access restrictions are automatically applied whenever system configurations are modified or updated. Any unauthorized changes trigger immediate alerts to system administrators.
- Recommended Practice: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to streamline access permissions management. Regularly review and update roles to reflect organizational changes.

These examples and recommended practices provide a foundation for organizations to implement robust access control mechanisms, ensuring secure and authorized access to information systems while minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. 


## AC-4 Information Flow Enforcement

### AC-4(1) 
Implement information flow control mechanisms.

- Example: Information flow control mechanisms are in place to prevent sensitive data from being transmitted outside the organization's network without proper encryption and authorization.
- Recommended Practice: Regularly monitor network traffic for data leaks and implement data loss prevention (DLP) solutions to prevent unauthorized information flow.
